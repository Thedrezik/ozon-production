## 001 — Single VPS bootstrap

Use Docker Compose with one FastAPI worker, a small SQLAlchemy pool, PostgreSQL, and Caddy serving a static PWA. This fits the initial 1 CPU / 1 GB RAM target and avoids a broker or extra worker service. Migrations run explicitly, not concurrently at every API start. The bootstrap has no business tables or real Ozon integration; later tasks add these behind an Ozon client boundary.
